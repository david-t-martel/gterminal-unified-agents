message: "# FIXME: Use list comprehension instead of append in loop"
severity: warning
language: python
rule:
  pattern: |
    $LIST = []
    for $VAR in $ITER:
        $LIST.append($EXPR)
fix: |
  $LIST = [$EXPR for $VAR in $ITER]
note: "List comprehensions are typically 2-3x faster than append loops"
