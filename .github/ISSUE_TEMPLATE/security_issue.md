## ⚠️ Security Issue

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security issues by:
1. Emailing us directly at security@example.com
2. Using GitHub's private security reporting feature

## What happens next?
1. We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. We'll investigate and provide updates
3. We'll coordinate disclosure if confirmed

Thank you for helping keep our project secure!
