## Design Decisions

### Architecture
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between UI, Business Logic, Tools, and Infrastructure
- **Service Locator Pattern**: Currently used, planned migration to Dependency Injection
- **Abstract Base Classes**: Tool extensibility through well-defined interfaces
- **Configuration-Driven**: No hardcoded values, all settings configurable

### Caching Strategy
- **Command Cache**: LRU cache with 100 entries for frequently used commands
- **File Cache**: 10MB limit for frequently accessed files
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Achieved 90%+ for typical usage patterns
- **TTL Management**: Automatic expiration for stale data

### Security
- **Command Whitelisting**: Only approved commands can be executed
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated before processing
- **OWASP Compliance**: Proactive security vulnerability detection
- **Service Account Only**: No API keys, only service account authentication

### Testing Philosophy
- **Mandatory Coverage**: 85% minimum code coverage requirement
- **Automatic Test Generation**: Tests created automatically after code changes
- **Comprehensive Fixtures**: Shared test infrastructure in conftest.py
- **CI/CD Integration**: All tests run on every commit

### Error Handling
- **Specific Exceptions**: No generic exceptions, specific error types
- **Comprehensive Recovery**: Graceful degradation for all error scenarios
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging

## Code Patterns

### Async/Await Pattern
```python
async def process_command(self, command: str) -> str:
    """All I/O operations use async/await"""
    result = await self.executor.run_command(command)
    return result
```

### Tool Abstraction
```python
class Tool(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all tools"""
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Any:
        pass
```

### Configuration Management
```python
@dataclass
class Config:
    """Configuration with no hardcoded values"""
    service_account_path: str = field(
        default_factory=lambda: os.getenv("GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS")
    )
```

### Streaming Operations
```python
async def read_file_streaming(self, path: str):
    """Memory-efficient file reading"""
    async with aiofiles.open(path, 'r') as f:
        async for line in f:
            yield line
```

### Unified Execution
```python
class CommandExecutor:
    """Single point for all command execution"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = LRUCache(maxsize=100)
    
    async def execute(self, command: str) -> str:
        if cached := self.cache.get(command):
            return cached
        result = await self._run_command(command)
        self.cache.put(command, result)
        return result
```
